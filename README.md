# SME-Driven Employee Attrition Prediction Project

This project aims to predict which employees are likely to leave a company using machine learning. The approach involves SME-driven data labeling, clustering, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a machine learning model to identify which employees are likely to leave the company. The dataset provided contains anonymized employee features without departure labels. Limited queries to a virtual SME (John) are allowed to label a subset of the data for training purposes.

## ðŸ›  Key Features
**Data Source**: [Employee dataset from UMBC Data Science repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msaricaumbc/DS_data/master/ds602/final/employee_departure_dataset_X.csv)

**Techniques Used**:
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- SMOTE for class imbalance
- Ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Model evaluation using F1-score and ROC AUC
- Model serialization with joblib

---

## âœ¨ Project Highlights
- Performed clustering on employee data for representative sampling.
- Collected labels from SMEs to guide model training.
- Trained classification models to predict attrition risk.
- Evaluated models for precision, recall, and overall performance.
